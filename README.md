# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Memory Card

This is my second react application. It is a web app game that tests your memory! The user is provided with a set of 12 flags. The objective is to click on a flag that you haven't clicked on before, which will result in a point. Once the user clicks a flag, the flag positions are shuffled. The user should keep going, until they accidentally click a flag that they already clicked, which restarts the current score.

Because I already worked on a react app with class components, and then I converted them to functional components, I was fairly comfortable with working with react. The idea was to create this app with nothing but functional components and hooks, in order to solidify my knowledge of them.

**_ Future Potential Improvements _**

I would like to add a winning screen after the user receives 12 points, which would include a button to play again.

Finally, because I chose flags that are, generally speaking, very recognizable, I would like to add levels to my game, with harder to recognize flags.
